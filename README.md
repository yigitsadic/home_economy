# Home Economy

Keeping track of your expenses and incomes becomes important after 20ties or 30ties and I am no different. After using Google Sheets for tracking my monthly expenses,
decided to create a local application for tracking my financial status the way I like.

This project only intended for personal usage and I'll organize things that fit my preferences.
